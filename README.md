# One-math-game
Just a simple web game with basic equation and number 1.

One Math Game is a game on web that I made on Glitch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The ideal purpose of the game is to boost your focus in the early morning by solving quick maths. You can try out the game on [My GitHub Pages](https://bruceho293.github.io/assets/one-math-game/index.html). 

If you want to alter the game or make it look nicer, you can clone this repo and make your own adjustment.
